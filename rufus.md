RUFUS is a free program that allows you to install or repair operating systems on your computer using USB sticks (flash drives). 
For example, you want to install an operating system like Windows or Linux on your computer, but you don't have or don't want to use a CD/DVD drive. 
This is where RUFUS comes in handy.
RUFUS transfers the operating system file you downloaded from the Internet (these files are often called “ISO files”) to your USB stick in the correct way and makes it ready for this process. 
This means that you can easily install an operating system by simply plugging the USB stick into your computer and starting the computer from it.
This method is faster and more convenient than using a CD/DVD. 
Also, since most newer computers do not have CD/DVD drives, it is much more convenient to do this with USB sticks. 
In short, With RUFUS, you can install or repair an operating system easily and quickly.
